# 6744-Swerve-Development

### 6744 Experimental Swerve Robot Fall 2024
This project will develop software to run a FRC swerve robot that uses REV MAXSwerve Modules and will use the MAXSwerve Java Template v2023.1 as a starting place.

The original Maxswerve README can be found in the MAXSwerveReadme.md file.

## Development approach

- Code and test all new features and fixes on specific topic branches. 
- After successfully testing a topic branch submit a pull request to merge it with the development-tst branch for itegration and testing its readiness for demo or competition. 
- Development branches are given a version number. The first will be development-v1. Once a version of the development branch is shown to be fully functional and ready for robot practice runs, demostrations or competition it will be merged with the main branch and work on that that version development branch will cease.

## development-v1 plans 11/14/24

### startup topic branch:
 Modifications to get the swerve prototype up and driving in teleop mode. The approach is to make the minimum changes needed to get the prototype running for intial evaluation. This branch will be pulled to development-v1 after successful testing on the robot.

### autodrive topic branch:
Modifications to provide a simple drive distance autonomous function. These modification may include some of the autonomous code developed for Crescendo This branch will be pulled to development-v1 after successful testing on the robot.
